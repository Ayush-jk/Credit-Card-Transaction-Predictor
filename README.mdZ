Credit Card Transactions Analysis

**Project Overview:**
The project involved the analysis of credit card transactions in India, focusing on exploring spending patterns across different cities using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and time series forecasting models.

**Dataset:**
The dataset "Credit card transactions - India - Simple.csv" includes the following columns:
- City: The city where the transaction occurred.
- Date: The transaction date.
- Card Type: The type of credit card used.
- Exp Type: The expense category associated with the transaction.
- Gender: The cardholder's gender.
- Amount: The transaction amount.

**Analysis:**
The analysis comprised the following steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Examined data distribution, trends, and anomalies.
   - Explored correlations between variables.
2. Data Understanding:
   - Summarized key statistics and insights from the dataset.
3. Model Training:
   - Employed three different time series forecasting models: ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet.
4. Evaluation:
   - Assessed model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

**Files:**
- Credit card transactions - India - Simple.csv: The primary dataset.
- analysis.py: A Python script for data analysis and model training.
- README.md: An overview of the project.

**Actual Vs. Statistical Problem:**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This step involves understanding and identifying patterns within the data, as well as addressing inconsistencies and missing data.

Model: Statistical models simplify complex relationships, enable predictions based on data, and are tested using real-world data to ensure accuracy.

**Model Performance Evaluation Metrics:**
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error): This metric calculates the average differences between predicted and actual values. It quantifies prediction errors.
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): This metric calculates the error in terms of percentage, providing additional insight into model performance.
